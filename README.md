## Application Objectives
The Kitchen Assistant is an app to help an individual plan out their meal by sharing easy food recipes, while also maintaining a record of available items in the inventory. The app does not only help maintain that, it also helps the user to create a shopping list and adds items to it according to the shortage of ingredients required for any particular recipe.
Using this app is very easy and convinient. A user can quickly and effortlessly view what all recipes are available in the system and choose any according to their liking. They can also view the items in the inventory and can manually add more items or change the amount of the available items.
The app also displays the shopping list, and provides the user with the option to add/remove items to it.
